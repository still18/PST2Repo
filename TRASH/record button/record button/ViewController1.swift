//this file is the playback file, i am following this tutorial...i am trying to set it up right now to test the audio recorder but I'm getting stuck on figuring out how to link the storyboard.storyboard to the main page... and then i have to chang the class of the 2nd storyboard on that page to view controller...if we ge this working we should be able to use it for song playback as well

Rather than being purely randomized, or drawing from a set playlist, Move-it Music uses the given inputs to narrow down and select the most fitting songs for your given activity and mood. Additionally, your motion data will be lightly monitored so that if there is a big change in your movement, the music will adjust accordingly. For more information on exactly how this is accomplished, please consult our GitHub page (link below).")

On the presets page, start by chosing your activity or whatever matches best. \"Move-it\" music works even if you're not moving, so if you're just sitting with friends it will work just fine. Then, flip on the switches for all of the genres you'd like Move-it Music to choose from. Our algorithms will try to select songs of the selected genres first, though you may here other related songs if you don't have many on your device. Next, look at the following 4 switches and move it to the side that best describes your mood. Right below that you can change the speed of your music (which is indicated in BPM below) using the slider. Finally, hit \"Set my choices!\" and after a couple seconds your music will start to play! If at any time you'd like to change your selections, just go back to the back page and hit the button again after changing the desired options. [PLAYBACK INFORMATION HERE]")
